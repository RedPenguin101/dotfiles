# WM Requirements

Patterns I would like:
* Sliding Window manager
  * Opening app 1 fills the screen. 
  * Opening app 2 puts both on half screen (new app on LHS)
  * Opening app 3 'slides' app 1 off to the right, shows app 3 (LHS) app 2 (RHS)
  * Closing either app 2/3 will slide app 1 back on from the right.
* Super + L/R changes window focus
* Super + U makes focus window full screen. D goes back to tile view
* Ctrl+Super+L/R Promotes/Demotes current window
* Can 'lock' LHS app so it stays in place through above operations

Stuff I like in Ubuntu/Gnome 3.36:
* super+arrow to 'move and lock' to side / half size screen
* minimal top bar
* super for activities: shows open windows, type for program launcher
* Mouse click "finger" emulation: 2 fingers for RC, 3 for MC
* Alt tab
* Super shortcuts

Stuff I don't like in Gnome
* Need a topbar at all? Only thing is battery and logout
* Gnome heavy
* Super 'zoom out' is unecessary, could just be a program launcher
* Side bar is unecessary
