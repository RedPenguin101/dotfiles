# WM Requirements

## My ideal WM
* Low mouse
* Screen has a top-bar and Desktop
* Desktop is 'two at a time' model, only ever 2 windows on screen. Good for laptops/small screens.
* Topbar: time, status, nothing else
* Desktop is divided into Primary/Secondary windows, and stack of windows. Stacks are not visible by default
* Windows can be named.

### Sliding Window manager
* App 1 opens in Primary, fills the screen
* App 2 opens in Primary, App 1 is demoted to secondary. Primary takes up LHS of Screen, Secondary is RHS
* App 3 opens in Primary (LHS), App 2 demoted to Secondary (RHS), App 3 demoted to Stack (off screen)
* Closing App 3 will promote App 2 to Primary, App 1 to Secondary
* Or, closing App 2 will promote app 1 to secondary
* Super + L/R changes window focus
* Super + U makes focus window full screen. D goes back to Primary/Secondary view
* Ctrl+Super+L/R Promotes/Demotes current window. If a secondary is demoted to stack, the top of the stack becomes Secondary and focused window
* Can 'lock' Primary window so it stays in place when opening new apps (i.e. new apps will become secondary, not primary)

### Super menu
* Super explodes the stack, you can see mini versions of windows from P/S and all stack in horizontal carousel
* Change selection with L/R. 
* Enter on selection promotes to Primary (or secondary if primary is locked)
* Ctrl L/R Promotes/demotes selection
* Super window has search bar that can be typed in. Typing filters application list, enter launches new application

## Ubuntu
Stuff I like in Ubuntu/Gnome 3.36:
* super+arrow to 'move and lock' to side / half size screen
* minimal top bar
* super for activities: shows open windows, type for program launcher
* Mouse click "finger" emulation: 2 fingers for RC, 3 for MC
* Alt tab
* Super shortcuts

Stuff I don't like in Gnome
* Need a topbar at all? Only thing is battery and logout
* Gnome heavy
* Super 'zoom out' is unnecessary, could just be a program launcher
* Side bar is unnecessary
